## Description
### *Game Description and Instructions*

A classic Snake Game implemented in C++ using the SDL2 library. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, which makes the snake grow longer and increase the score. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.

*The game offers three modes for players to enjoy:*
+ **Game mode 1 - EASY:**
  
*In Easy Mode, the snake moves at a slower speed, making it easier for players to control and navigate. This mode is ideal for beginners who are new to the game or prefer a more relaxed gameplay experience.*
+ **Game mode 2 - MEDIUM:**
  
*In Medium Mode, the snake moves at a moderate speed, offering a balanced level of difficulty. This mode is suitable for players who have some experience with the game and are looking for a moderate challenge. The frequency of food appearance is standard, and the obstacles are moderately placed, requiring players to be more attentive.*
+ **Game mode 3 - HARD:**
  
*In this hard mode the snake moves very fast and there are more obstacles than medium mode this mode is designed for who seek challenging gameplay experience*
